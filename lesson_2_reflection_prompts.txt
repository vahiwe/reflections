What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a file .git that keeps records of commits on files in the directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
the staging area acts as middleman between the working directory and commit thereby helping you seperate files
you want committed from the ones you dont want committed  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
you can add the relevant files you want to commit to the staging area before committing 
thus any file you dont want to commit doesnt go to the staging area

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
