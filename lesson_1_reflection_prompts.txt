How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It picked the lines of code that were different in both files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It reduces the amount of time it takes in finding error in codes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    For the pros, you choose when to make a commit to Git especially when you've made a major change in your code while
	the con is that you might forget to commit after making some minor changes in your code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is because while working on a project, multiple files have relationship with each other thus Git commits all
	files at once to keep with the multiple changes made in the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    when git log is typed it shows the history of all commits with IDs to identify them. git diff is used to compare 
	different commits using their IDs gotten from the history as reference to the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me not afraid of changing my code because i can revert back to a code that worked earlier and easily fix 
	the error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'll use it in saving files related to any project i work on
