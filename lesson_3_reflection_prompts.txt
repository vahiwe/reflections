When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when u want your file accessible online and sharable. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because there might be changes in the remote repository that might conflict your local
	changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   forks is used only in github to create a copy of a repository in your github account
	clones is creating a copy of repository from github to your local directory or
	duplicating a repository in your local directory
	branches is used to deviate from your main code and add new features
	
	i'll use fork if i wanted to duplicate a github repository into my github account
	i'll use clone if i wanted to to duplicate a github repository into my local directly
	i'll use branch if i want to add new features to the project but dont want it to affect the
	rest of the code until i'm sure it works

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    it enables you to be able to identify the new changes that have been added to the remote repository

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    we could collaborate using emails by sending files over emails. github would be easier because of the features put in place
	to manage changes in the files

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
